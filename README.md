# Bike-Sales-DashBoard
This is an Excel DashBoard for Bike Sales across the  some selected regions.
Please note that there is the raw data and  also the project data after the raw data had been cleaned


### Task 1: Remove Duplicates

Before proceeding with any data analysis, you should remove duplicates from your dataset. You mentioned there are about 25 duplicates.

### Task 2: Standardize Marital Status and Gender

To make the data more understandable, perform a Find & Replace operation to standardize "Martial Status" and "Gender" values:
- Replace "Ms" with "Married" and "Ss" with "Single" in the "Martial Status" column.
- Replace "Ms" with "Male" and "Fs" with "Female" in the "Gender" column.

### Task 3: Format Currency

Remove decimals from the currency values to make them look cleaner. You can round the values to the nearest whole number.

### Task 4: Create Age Brackets

Create a new column called "Age Bracket" and categorize the ages into ranges. You can use an IF statement or Excel's range tab to define age brackets like "18-25," "26-35," "36-45," etc.

### Task 5: Create a Pivot Table

Create a pivot table with the cleaned data. This will serve as a foundation for your analysis.

### Task 6: Analyze Salary and Bike Purchase

In the pivot table, add columns for "Gender" and "Bike Purchase." Calculate the average salary for each combination of gender and bike purchase. Use this information to draw conclusions about salary and bike purchase behavior.

### Task 7: Analyze Distance and Bike Purchase

Check the data to determine whether the distance from work affects bike purchase decisions. You can use pivot tables or charts to visualize this relationship.

### Task 8: Analyze Age Ranges and Bike Purchase

Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts or pie charts) to analyze how age ranges (from Task 4) relate to bike purchases. This will help you understand which age groups are more likely to buy bikes.

### Task 9: Create a Dashboard

Design a dashboard that incorporates the insights from the previous tasks. Use tools like Excel, Tableau, or Power BI to create a visually appealing and informative dashboard.

### Task 10: Create Slicers

Add slicers to your dashboard to allow users to filter and interact with the data dynamically. Slicers can help users focus on specific aspects of the data, such as gender, age range, or bike purchase status.
